# Lesson 1

**What is C#:**
- Used for Unit and ASP.NET
- Has define type of each data, which essentially tells a computer what operations can and cannot by performed on a piece of data
- Programs are built by defining objects that interact with each other

## Defining data types

Similar to `Flutter` version 1, when defining a variable the data `type` is also defined at the same time. For example:  
```csharp
string my_name = "Emma"
```

## Comments

Also, as in `Flutter` comments are denoted with `//`. For example:
```csharp
/* This variable will be used to count the number of times anyone tweets the word persnickety */
int persnicketyCount = 0;
```
and
```csharp
/* Calculates tomorrow's rain likelihood as a number between 0 and 100 */
ComplicatedRainCalculationForTomorrow();
```

Multi-line commentes are defined between `/*` and `*/`.

## Printing text to the cmd-line

`Console.WriteLine()` is used to print text to the cmd-line.  
For example:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!")
```

## Reading user input

`Console.ReadLine` captures text that a user types into the console.

## Csharp in the wild
.NET is a framewrk for C#
The company Raygun's adoption of C# increased their programs productivity 2,000%, from processing 1,000 requests per secont to 20,000 requests per second.

[GitHub](https://octoverse.github.com/) ranked C# as the fifth most popular programming language, and it was ranked 7th by [StackOverflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-popular-technologies).

C# is widely used by .NET developers to build a range of programs and applications. In the 2019 HackerRank Developer Skills Report, expertise in two C#-compatible frameworks, ASP.NET and .NET Core, were among the top ten most sought-after by managers.
